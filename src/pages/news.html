              <span>Although the Brackley-based team has long declared through the words of Team Prinicpal Toto Wolff that attention is now directed towards the concept of the 2024 car, the development of the current challenger has not yet finished.

              It should be emphasized that this is not a development with the intention of further increasing the performance of this car - which various signs indicate is now paused - but to gradually understand in which direction to invest in the concept of next season's car. </p>

                <br><br>

              <span>First there was the unusual Friday with Free Practice 1 an effective washout and teams trying to save tyres in the afternoon session, meaning the usual true Free Practice 2 picture did not emerge. </span> <br><br>
